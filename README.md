# YouTubeSubCount
Get the number of subscribers from any YouTube channel in less than 20 easy to read lines of code!

## How to use:
Enter the profile url for any YouTube channel.  To test, enter a blank string and a url will be provided for you


## Motivation
I wanted to receive a notification when a YouTuber I like hit a certain subscriber count.  I integrated this with an texting/sms library and put the code in a loop to constantly update and it texted me when that threshold was met.
